**Data Preparation**

Data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query Editor:
I thoroughly reviewed the dataset to ensure all information was accurate and consistent. The only data quality issue I found was incorrect data types date columns, which I corrected to ensure accurate calculations.

**Analysis and Findings**

The dashboard provides an overview of total sales, including the quantity of products sold and the gross income generated. 
Average Rating: Customers have rated the overall products at an average of 7.16 out of 10. Sales Trends and Patterns:

**Sales by City:**

Naypyitaw recorded the highest sales with Yangon and Mandalay following closely. This suggests that sales potential is relatively balanced across the three cities.

**Sales by Payment Method:**

Credit cards are the most popular payment method, followed by cash and e-wallets.

**Sales by Time:**

The busiest hours for sales are likely between 10:00 AM and 16:00 PM, based on the graph.

**Customer Type Analysis**

Member/Non-Member:
Sales from Members 53.16% slightly exceeded those from Normal customers 47.3%, suggesting that both customer groups are vital, but members contribute marginally more to the overall revenue.

**Product Line Sales**

The Health and beauty category achieved the highest sales followed by Sports and travel. This suggests that consumable and lifestyle products are the most popular among customers.

**Branch Performance:**

The dashboard shows that Branch C has the highest profit, followed by Branch A and Branch B.

**Recommendations**

**Focus on High-Demand Products**

Given the high sales in the Health and beauty category, it would be beneficial to prioritize inventory and marketing efforts for these items.

**Optimize Store Hours**

Consider ensuring adequate staffing during the peak sales period to accommodate the customer flow.

**Customer Satisfaction:**

Gathering customer feedback through surveys or reviews can help improve product offerings and customer service.
